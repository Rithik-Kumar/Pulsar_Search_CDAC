# Pulsar Search using HPC and Machine Learning.

The significant rise in the number of pulsar candidates due to the advancement of survey
specifications are making it difficult to classify pulsars from non-pulsars. This paper
discuss about various Machine Learning techniques to classify pulsars in a fast and
precise manner. The data used for training are provided by NCRA (National Centre
for Radio Astrophysics). Our approach can process a large amount of candidates in
seconds, with a high level of pulsar recall (90+ percent).
